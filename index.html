<br> Hi guys, my name is Nguyen Duc Khang. I am from Viet Nam. I am a first-year student of RMIT in IT major. I can speak Vietnamese and English.I loves to build a PC, optimizes it to make it better or take something apart and then put it all together, into its original form. I also play Frisbee, because it is a fantastic sport where players can increase the strength health, keep fit better and have a happy time during they are playing. My interest in IT is about how to build a system like a PC, to combine different hardware together, make or create a software to compatible with as many hardware as possible. That interest starts from when I was 3-4 years-old. </br>

<br>I am Hoang Ngoc Anh Duc with the ID is s3818988. My hobbies are Gym, badminton, play game, listen to music. I have found that IT is one of the most important things is this 4.0 era and I can solve many problems if I good at this major. I started to like this major since I was 15 after watching a video from a Vietnamese guy making his AI called virtual assistant like Siri of Apple or Cortana of Microsoft. This Vietnamese guy got his master of AI certificate when he was 21 in Swinburne university and he also the lead tutor of AI in this school at the moment. And I was made my first virtual assistant by using his instruction without any knowledge about python.</br>

<br>I'm Hoan Minh Khoi from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I can speak 2 languages Vietnamese and English. I like playing video games, in fact, when I was a high-schooler, during the summerbreak, I used to sit in front of the screen for 8-12 hours a day, sometimes I even reached 14-6 hours. I still love playing games but now 3-4 hours of screen time is my highest.The 2 aspect that I like the most about IT is game industry and smart house setup. I like playing video game since I was a middle-schooler but the interest in smart house is recent. I have none of IT experience yet</br>

<h3>Group processes</h3>
<p>In assignment 2, our group had done well and work effectively together. In Assignment 2, we had separated works into individual and group parts. Each member needed to complete their individual works before setup of the deadline.  In assignment 3, we also separate the work into two parts same as the previous assignment. Our processes will not change through the assignment 3. Each member needs to complete the deadline before the setup of the deadline so that we will have time for groups part. Group part includes presentation, some of assignment’s requirements, and website design.  </p>
<h3>Career Plans</h3>
<p>Khoi and Duc
Khoi and Duc have the same ideal position which is full stack developer and this rank 17th in the rate of demand. For the job, they need to know how to use most of popular programming languages and techniques, especially Java, Python and C++. And, for the general skills, they need to have such skills as problem solving, creativity, multi-tasking, English and maybe communication skills. All of these skills rank slatternly on both IT skills and general skills charts of demand. Java and JavaScript rank 2nd and 3rd; Python is located at 22nd; the last program is C++ but we cannot see it on the chart. There are other high demand skills too like Building relationships, Project management and Business management but we do not think they will need those anytime soon. In addition, they chose this type of job since the beginning, even after seeing the Burning Glass data, they still have not changed their mind yet because now they know that this job demand is plenty enough.</p>

<p>Khang
My job is placed in the system administrator section according to Burning Glass International Inc. That job requires me to have a knowledge of Java Script, project management, and Python to be in that position. The most important skill is using Python fluently because as an administrator, you must know how to create software. If you can use python smoothly, it is easier for you to write a normal software. The other skills are Project management and Java Script is also important, all of the three combines will help administrator to know more about working and manage a group when they have to work in a group, a part of a company. Regarding genetic skills, I think that as a system administrator, you must have communication skills, collaboration, problem-solving, and planning to create a good workflow. Standing in the first place is communication skill because as a system administrator you must talk and have conversations to your company workers about the work that the whole group is working on. Followed by problem-solving skills. Coming up next although the system administrator does not require to have collaboration and planning, and leadership, team building, and the last one is English, it is good to have all of that skill if you want to have a better promotion opportunity at work.

</p>
<p>Nick
Nick job title is Web developer. His job title ranked 11th which counted from the below. His dream job required JAVA, Python, and Git. JAVA skill gets the highest rank in my job required. Python and Git are the important skills, but its ranks are low which are 4th and 5th counted from the below. What is about genetic skill? Web developer requires lots of skills such as English, communication skill, problem solving and creativity. Their ranks are difference from each other. Communication skill has the 1st rank. The second rank is taken by problem solving skill. English is his lowest skill. Business Management, SAP, and Microsoft Window are IT skill that my job is not required but web developer need to understand and know little bit about those skills. Troubleshooting, Research, and Leadership are the three highest rank of genetic skills that web developer not required but they are good and important to make people become expert IT.

<p>Compare and contrast:
Duc and Khoi’s ideal job is full stacked developer while Nam and Khang’s ideal jobs are developer and web developer. Duc and Khoi’s ideal job is same as each other so that their job requirements are same. Nam's job requirements are JAVA, Python, and Git. Khang's jobs requirements are Experience in software development (5 years), Experience in manager position (3 years), Full commercial application development, and PMP certification (Project Management Professional). Our career plans make us work more effectively in a group. We know well about what our teammates is good at and each other’s career plans. We are working good enough until now. We had separated the assignment into two different parts which are individual, and group works.

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Topic:    </p>
<p>Motivation:    </p>
<p>Landscape:   </p>


<h3>Detailed Description</h3>

<p>Aims</p>

<p>Plans and Progress</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>
  <li>Duc: Lead developer which means he will lead the time limit and processes of everyone's works to make sure the products will works effectively and every things will be following the plans. Moreover, he also does the producing and pricing,  marketing managing and take the responsibility of providing products to the market. </li>

<li>Nick: Website designer who has to do the CSS/HTML parts because the website has to attract people and make them feel interested in our technology products. Also, he has to research about the helmet's material and build it a certainty.</li>

<li>Khoi: Technical Designer means he has to research about modern technology of google glass and apply it into the helmet because this project came from his ideas and he is the one who knew clearly the technology of AR and smart glasses. </li>

<li>Khang: He will be the User Interface Designer(UX, UI designer). He is the guy that draws the AR interface of the smart glass so the user experience relies on him. He has to design the map, icons and notifications in a reasonable way and avoid distracting people when driving.</li>
</p>

<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>

<p>Tools and Technologies: Augmented Reality (AR): We use this technology to connect real life with the virtual world so that the user can still have awareness about the surrounding when looking at the interface of the helmet.
	Holographic Display: This display is similar to the modern car. There will be a mini projector to display the image onto the glass surface. Because this will be less noticeable than if there is a high contrast screen, the user can clearly keep their eyes on the road.
  Surround sound record and playback: The helmet will have a microphone outside of the helmet to capture the noise of the environment and mimic that through the built-in surround stereo headphone. This feature will always turn on and not be adjustable, we make this decision to force the driver to keep awareness of the traffic.
	Bluetooth: this is the way to connect the helmet with your phone to play the music and display the google maps from your own personal device. This way the helmet does not need to connect to wifi, all wifi related functions can be processed on the user’s phone and it’s data.
	Google Glass, Maps and Assistant: we will try to buy the license from google to use their technologies and apply that on our product. We use their technology to control the whole system, apply the AR function and use GPS. Because we use Google Maps, it will show the direction and crowded roads to help the driver.
  Emergency Alert: when there is an acidence, the helmet will use a microwave to check whether the user’s still have consciousness. It will automatically call the medical service if the user has passed out.If the user still has their awareness, the helmet will ask whether they need it or not and wait for the user to answer.
	Voice Control: To make the driver keep both of their hands on the handle bar, we have to find a hands-free method for the user to interact with the helmet. We found out that a voice control system is the best option. There will be a microphone attached to the mouth cover part of the helmet, and through that microphone the user can command the helmet as they want.
Recyclable material: Nowadays, electronic waste disposal is a big issue in the world. Electronic devices keep being improved and released every year, so everyone has to throw away the old ones to get the new design. By using recyclable materials, in future if we release the newer version, we can still recycle the one helmet. </p>

<p>Testing: We will have some physical tests for a normal helmet. Firstly, we will undertake the impact test, the reason behind this test is the safety for the drivers who wear it. We have to make sure our product is durable enough to protect the users. Next will be the water proof test, because there will be rainy days, the helmet should resist rain water to protect the electric components inside.
For the user interaction test, we will look for 10 to 20 volunteers. We will give 3 helmets to 3 people from that group to use for 3 days each time. After 3 days, those 3 helmets will be given to the 3 others from the same group. Then, we will ask them to give a report during the end of their tests. Each time they give us a report, we will have a day to adjust and fix the bugs. This will take 3, 4 or more weeks to undertake the testing, this will be dependent on the bugs and difficulties that we can find during the testing. We will finish the test if 3 groups in the row are fully satisfied with the result.

<h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
<p>We impressed about our group because we always have a meeting to do our project and assignment together. We usually used technology to chat and setup the meeting places. We usually used applications such as Messengers, Phone Calls, and Outlook Microsoft Email. We always met face to face so that we can communicate together and fix the other problems or mistakes. If my team has a member that not response in team chat or works, we will have a meeting as a team to solve the problem. We expect that every member needs to have the attention at least 3 days a week because we always have meeting 5 times a week which means every weekday. We usually have a meeting in the café shop or in RMIT meeting rooms.

<p>Skills and Jobs</p>
<p>If I have the investment from the venture capitalists and chance to become a leader of groups of 4 people, I will employ the people with these requirements. First, my requirement is technology skills expert. The project is smart helmet so that it requires a lot of technology knowledge to manage and control it. if the workers are beginner in IT area, they cannot work in this project. The reason is smart helmet is a high technology device so that it requires the newest knowledge and expert in skills to work on it. In my opinion, I think that my team can improve and make the project to the next phase with the investment from the venture capitalists. What skill are required to expert? Graphic design, Business Management, and Building Relationship are important skills that this project needed. Graphic design skill will improve the functions and the appearance of the project so that the helmet will be better and easy to get close to the customers. Business Management skill can help the workers to make their timetable and works so that they will work effectively. One more important factor that this skill can help the workers is they will have the responsibility for their own works. Finally, Building Relationship will make link the workers to the employ or workers to other companies’ members. The better relationship is the better outcome will improve in the future. Relationship is important in business and cooperation.
 Next, Creativity is the next important requirements in my requirement to employ people for my team. Creativity is important because it will bring the project the next phase with new function, appearance, and the way to get the attention from the customers. Finally, working as a group is hard if team members do not work together effectively so that my most important requirement is teamwork. All four people need to have the ability to work in a team. If my teammates work together effectively, the project will be better in the future.
