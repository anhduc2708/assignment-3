<br> Hi guys, my name is Nguyen Duc Khang. I am from Viet Nam. I am a first-year student of RMIT in IT major. I can speak Vietnamese and English.I loves to build a PC, optimizes it to make it better or take something apart and then put it all together, into its original form. I also play Frisbee, because it is a fantastic sport where players can increase the strength health, keep fit better and have a happy time during they are playing. My interest in IT is about how to build a system like a PC, to combine different hardware together, make or create a software to compatible with as many hardware as possible. That interest starts from when I was 3-4 years-old. </br>

I started to like this major since I was 15 after watching a video from a Vietnamese guy making his AI called virtual assistant like Siri of Apple or Cortana of Microsoft. This Vietnamese guy got his master of AI certificate when he was 21 in Swinburne university and he also the lead tutor of AI in this school at the moment. And I was made my first virtual assistant by using his instruction without any knowledge about python.</br>

<h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
<p>We impressed about our group because we always have a meeting to do our project and assignment together. We usually used technology to chat and setup the meeting places. We usually used applications such as Messengers, Phone Calls, and Outlook Microsoft Email. We always met face to face so that we can communicate together and fix the other problems or mistakes. If my team has a member that not response in team chat or works, we will have a meeting as a team to solve the problem. We expect that every member needs to have the attention at least 3 days a week because we always have meeting 5 times a week which means every weekday. We usually have a meeting in the café shop or in RMIT meeting rooms.
