<p><br>I am Tran Chan Nam(Nick), My ID number is s3804825, My national is Vietnam. I can spoke 2 languages which are Vietnammese and English. I am a person who always be friendly. Black coffee without sugar is my favorite drink.I have a special feeling with the ball that I can't describe how strong and special is it. Football is my life. I always find the ball and practice myself when I have freetime. I loved to "destoying my laptop" and also find new thing in technology world. That's my IT interest. I have some soft skills and knowledge in open and repair devices.</br></p>

<br> Hi guys, my name is Nguyen Duc Khang. I am from Viet Nam. I am a first-year student of RMIT in IT major. I can speak Vietnamese and English.I loves to build a PC, optimizes it to make it better or take something apart and then put it all together, into its original form. I also play Frisbee, because it is a fantastic sport where players can increase the strength health, keep fit better and have a happy time during they are playing. My interest in IT is about how to build a system like a PC, to combine different hardware together, make or create a software to compatible with as many hardware as possible. That interest starts from when I was 3-4 years-old. </br>

<center><img src="ducprofile.jpg" width="400px"></center>

<br>I am Hoang Ngoc Anh Duc with the ID is s3818988. My hobbies are Gym, badminton, play game, listen to music. I have found that IT is one of the most important things is this 4.0 era and I can solve many problems if I good at this major. I started to like this major since I was 15 after watching a video from a Vietnamese guy making his AI called virtual assistant like Siri of Apple or Cortana of Microsoft. This Vietnamese guy got his master of AI certificate when he was 21 in Swinburne university and he also the lead tutor of AI in this school at the moment. And I was made my first virtual assistant by using his instruction without any knowledge about python.</br>

<center> <img src="khoiprofile.png" width="200px"></center>
<br>I'm Hoan Minh Khoi from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I can speak 2 languages Vietnamese and English. I like playing video games, in fact, when I was a high-schooler, during the summerbreak, I used to sit in front of the screen for 8-12 hours a day, sometimes I even reached 14-6 hours. I still love playing games but now 3-4 hours of screen time is my highest.The 2 aspect that I like the most about IT is game industry and smart house setup. I like playing video game since I was a middle-schooler but the interest in smart house is recent. I have none of IT experience yet</br>

<h3 style="color:red" >Group processes</h3>
<p>In assignment 2, our group had done well and work effectively together. In Assignment 2, we had separated works into individual and group parts. Each member needed to complete their individual works before setup of the deadline.  In assignment 3, we also separate the work into two parts same as the previous assignment. Our processes will not change through the assignment 3. Each member needs to complete the deadline before the setup of the deadline so that we will have time for groups part. Group part includes presentation, some of assignment’s requirements, and website design.  </p>

<h3 style="color:red" >Career Plans</h3>

<p>Khoi and Duc
Khoi and Duc have the same ideal position which is full stack developer and this rank 17th in the rate of demand. For the job, they need to know how to use most of popular programming languages and techniques, especially Java, Python and C++. And, for the general skills, they need to have such skills as problem solving, creativity, multi-tasking, English and maybe communication skills. All of these skills rank slatternly on both IT skills and general skills charts of demand. Java and JavaScript rank 2nd and 3rd; Python is located at 22nd; the last program is C++ but we cannot see it on the chart. There are other high demand skills too like Building relationships, Project management and Business management but we do not think they will need those anytime soon. In addition, they chose this type of job since the beginning, even after seeing the Burning Glass data, they still have not changed their mind yet because now they know that this job demand is plenty enough.</p>

<p>Khang
My job is placed in the system administrator section according to Burning Glass International Inc. That job requires me to have a knowledge of Java Script, project management, and Python to be in that position. The most important skill is using Python fluently because as an administrator, you must know how to create software. If you can use python smoothly, it is easier for you to write a normal software. The other skills are Project management and Java Script is also important, all of the three combines will help administrator to know more about working and manage a group when they have to work in a group, a part of a company. Regarding genetic skills, I think that as a system administrator, you must have communication skills, collaboration, problem-solving, and planning to create a good workflow. Standing in the first place is communication skill because as a system administrator you must talk and have conversations to your company workers about the work that the whole group is working on. Followed by problem-solving skills. Coming up next although the system administrator does not require to have collaboration and planning, and leadership, team building, and the last one is English, it is good to have all of that skill if you want to have a better promotion opportunity at work.

</p>
<p>Nick
Nick job title is Web developer. His job title ranked 11th which counted from the below. His dream job required JAVA, Python, and Git. JAVA skill gets the highest rank in my job required. Python and Git are the important skills, but its ranks are low which are 4th and 5th counted from the below. What is about genetic skill? Web developer requires lots of skills such as English, communication skill, problem solving and creativity. Their ranks are difference from each other. Communication skill has the 1st rank. The second rank is taken by problem solving skill. English is his lowest skill. Business Management, SAP, and Microsoft Window are IT skill that my job is not required but web developer need to understand and know little bit about those skills. Troubleshooting, Research, and Leadership are the three highest rank of genetic skills that web developer not required but they are good and important to make people become expert IT.
</p>

<p>Compare and contrast:
Duc and Khoi’s ideal job is full stacked developer while Nam and Khang’s ideal jobs are developer and web developer. Duc and Khoi’s ideal job is same as each other so that their job requirements are same. Nam's job requirements are JAVA, Python, and Git. Khang's jobs requirements are Experience in software development (5 years), Experience in manager position (3 years), Full commercial application development, and PMP certification (Project Management Professional). Our career plans make us work more effectively in a group. We know well about what our teammates is good at and each other’s career plans. We are working good enough until now. We had separated the assignment into two different parts which are individual, and group works.

  <p><br>Comment:
  In this assignment 3, we continue to use the way of Github and Git function to link our work together same as Assignment 2. At this time, we already have some experiences in using Github, Git, and atom so that we got less conflicts and problems than the previous assignment. We can work together effectively at home.</br> </p>

<h2 style="color:blue" >Project Description</h2>

<h3 style="color:red" >Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic:</h4>
<p>
<br>We approach this project with a belief in better motorbike trips. Every Vietnamese person has to commute every day but to be honest, it is one of the most boring daily activities. Not only that, but it is also even inconvenient when we do not know how to navigate around the city and have to use GPS. Unlike driving a car where you can check your phone without serious risks like robbing and losing balance on a motorbike, we always have to face those pain if we decide to use GPS. Therefore, our helmet will be the solution to every motorbike driver’s problems.</br>
<br>With our smart helmet, it will change the behavior of people in Viet Nam while riding their own bikes on the road. Each trip travels with a motorbike will become less boring, feel more excited. It also helps the rider to concentrate more on the traffic, stay away from distraction while riding such as upcoming phone calls, text messages,... the helmet can create a brand new experience for people to feel more enjoyable, convenient and also makes their trip become safer than before.
</br>
</p>
<h4>Motivation:</h4>
<p>
  In normal daily life, we can not deny that the phone plays an important role in our life because it can handle many works such as receiving calls, emails,.., and also guiding people from this place to their final destination. But using phones while riding or driving in common is usually dangerous and even can cause unexpected accidents. That is where our idea came from, also the motivation for this project: to prevent accidents, increase the safety of riding motorbikes on the road.
</p>
<h4>Landscape:</h4>
<p>So far, there is some similar system or product that is also integrated into the speedometer of the motorbike. I think with this our product because our idea is more convenient, you don’t have to look at the road you are riding on and look down at the speedometer to see the notification or who is calling you at that time. With our idea, you just have to focus on the road, all of the notification will appear as well but it still maintains the view for the rider to focus while riding.
</p>


<h3 style="color:red" >Detailed Description</h3>

<h4>Aims:</h4>
<p>
This project aim towards the rider’s riding experience. Ride on a motorbike is not fun if you are riding alone, it is just full fill your desire. With our helmet, your trip will become more exciting, make it more colorful and also safer with the help of advanced technology. To full fill that aim, there are 2 main goals that need to be achieved is the convenience for riders while riding on a road and the concentration when you are riding, make the riding experience become safer, more excited and create a brand new world with the help of advanced technology.<br>
<br>About the first goal, while riding, you will feel really bored such as while you are riding in the city but in the rush hour, you just sit on your motorbike just move forward slowly because of the traffic jam. Our helmet can make you feel more exciting with the integrated speaker and projector inside the helmet, which will raise your experience into the new level, make your boring trip from your home to the office into a more excited, more interesting trip.</br>
<br>Into the second goal, the smart helmet will have an integrated device, which will present a new notification of who is calling or texting you, show the way from your place to your destination while you are riding without using your phone. To solve this problem, the system integrated into the helmet has to have an interface that is user-friendly and also easy to use. all of the above just to have the rider feel more confident, more convenient while riding on the road. Also, the helmet has to have sensors that will alert riders about the dangerous situations for the rider, also remind the rider to focus on the road if they have many notifications or continuous notification shows on the screen of the helmet system. All of that helps the riders to focus more on the road, increase the concentration while riding on a motorbike.</br>
</p>

<h4 >Plans and Progress</h4>

<h4 >Roles</h4>
<p>
  <li>Duc: Lead developer and project manager which means he will lead the time limit and processes of everyone's works to make sure the products will works effectively and every things will be following the plans. Moreover, he also does the producing and pricing,  marketing managing and take the responsibility of providing products to the market. </li>

<li>Nick: Website designer who has to do the CSS/HTML parts because the website has to attract people and make them feel interested in our technology products. Also, he has to research about the helmet's material and build it a certainty.</li>

<li>Khoi: Technical Designer means he has to research about modern technology of google glass and apply it into the helmet because this project came from his ideas and he is the one who knew clearly the technology of AR and smart glasses. </li>

<li>Khang: He will be the User Interface Designer(UX, UI designer). He is the guy that draws the AR interface of the smart glass so the user experience relies on him. He has to design the map, icons and notifications in a reasonable way and avoid distracting people when driving.</li>
</p>

<h3  style="color:red" >Scope and Limits</h3>
<p>After this project, we promise to deliver the helmet which everyone is always waiting for. We plan to apply as much useful modern technology as possible, especially, there will be some Google products as well. However, because there are many technologies, this also is the reason for the limits that we will come across during this project. Every project will have some errors during the progress, so do ours, and the way we use those technologies may create some conflicts and bugs, either big or small.</p>
<h4>Tools and Technologies:</h4>

<br>Augmented Reality (AR): We use this technology to connect real life with the virtual world so that the user can still have awareness about the surrounding when looking at the interface of the helmet.</br>
	<br>Holographic Display: This display is similar to the modern car. There will be a mini projector to display the image onto the glass surface. Because this will be less noticeable than if there is a high contrast screen, the user can clearly keep their eyes on the road.</br>
  <br>Surround sound record and playback: The helmet will have a microphone outside of the helmet to capture the noise of the environment and mimic that through the built-in surround stereo headphone. This feature will always turn on and not be adjustable, we make this decision to force the driver to keep awareness of the traffic.</br>
	<br>Bluetooth: This is the way to connect the helmet with your phone to play the music and display the google maps from your own personal device. This way the helmet does not need to connect to wifi, all wifi related functions can be processed on the user’s phone and it’s data.</br>
	<br>Google Glass, Maps and Assistant: We will try to buy the license from google to use their technologies and apply that on our product. We use their technology to control the whole system, apply the AR function and use GPS. Because we use Google Maps, it will show the direction and crowded roads to help the driver.</br>
  <br>Emergency Alert: When there is an acidence, the helmet will use a microwave to check whether the user’s still have consciousness. It will automatically call the medical service if the user has passed out.If the user still has their awareness, the helmet will ask whether they need it or not and wait for the user to answer.</br>
	<br>Voice Control: To make the driver keep both of their hands on the handle bar, we have to find a hands-free method for the user to interact with the helmet. We found out that a voice control system is the best option. There will be a microphone attached to the mouth cover part of the helmet, and through that microphone the user can command the helmet as they want.</br>
  <br>Recyclable material: Nowadays, electronic waste disposal is a big issue in the world. Electronic devices keep being improved and released every year, so everyone has to throw away the old ones to get the new design. By using recyclable materials, in future if we release the newer version, we can still recycle the one helmet.</br>
	<br>Build-in Dash Cam: This is for recording the user’s journey and commute. If the user loves to have a road trip but every now and then, buying an actual action camera such as a GoPro is too costly and wasteful, so they can just use the camera that is located on the forehead part. This also works as a dash cam which is alway recording our commute just in case that the user got into an accident.</br>

<h4>Testing:</h4>

<p>We will have some physical tests for a normal helmet. Firstly, we will undertake the impact test, the reason behind this test is the safety for the drivers who wear it. We have to make sure our product is durable enough to protect the users. Next will be the water proof test, because there will be rainy days, the helmet should resist rain water to protect the electric components inside.
For the user interaction test, we will look for 10 to 20 volunteers. We will give 3 helmets to 3 people from that group to use for 3 days each time. After 3 days, those 3 helmets will be given to the 3 others from the same group. Then, we will ask them to give a report during the end of their tests. Each time they give us a report, we will have a day to adjust and fix the bugs. This will take 3, 4 or more weeks to undertake the testing, this will be dependent on the bugs and difficulties that we can find during the testing. We will finish the test if 3 groups in the row are fully satisfied with the result.</p>

<h4>Timeframe:  </h4>
<center><img src="ohyeah.png" width="800px" height="350px"></center>
<h4>Risks:</h4>
<p> We need to hire a manufacturer to build the components and assemble the whole helmet for us because we are only able to do  the job related to IT. Therefore, our first problems that we can come across is there is no one willing to accept our offer. A worse version of this problem is unable to find an investor. Because this will be a very costly project, we need someone to sponsor us to buy and build all of the technology.
The second risk is a problem that every electronic device also sometimes has which is discovering bugs. Because we use so much technology and this is our first version, having small errors such as GPS pointing in the wrong direction, unable to pair with the smartphone, lost connection and battery failure are inevitable. There are also a lot more unexpected problems that we may come across during making or even after selling it.
Everyone will assume that because it is a helmet, it needs to be durable enough. However, our helmet will have electronics inside, so if we keep on throwing the helmet carelessly it may damage the component.
Our last concern is the result may turn out way more expensive than we think. Because we plan to apply a lot of modern technologies,  money may be a problem. If the retail products turn out expensive, no one will agree on buying a helmet that costs an arm and a leg. </p>

<h3 style="color:red" >Group processes and communications</h3>
<p>We impressed about our group because we always have a meeting to do our project and assignment together. We usually used technology to chat and setup the meeting places. We usually used applications such as Messengers, Phone Calls, and Outlook Microsoft Email. We always met face to face so that we can communicate together and fix the other problems or mistakes. If my team has a member that not response in team chat or works, we will have a meeting as a team to solve the problem. We expect that every member needs to have the attention at least 3 days a week because we always have meeting 5 times a week which means every weekday. We usually have a meeting in the café shop or in RMIT meeting rooms.

<h4>Skills and Jobs</h4>

<p>If I have the investment from the venture capitalists and chance to become a leader of groups of 4 people, I will employ the people with these requirements. First, my requirement is technology skills expert. The project is smart helmet so that it requires a lot of technology knowledge to manage and control it. if the workers are beginner in IT area, they cannot work in this project. The reason is smart helmet is a high technology device so that it requires the newest knowledge and expert in skills to work on it. In my opinion, I think that my team can improve and make the project to the next phase with the investment from the venture capitalists. What skill are required to expert? Graphic design, Business Management, and Building Relationship are important skills that this project needed. Graphic design skill will improve the functions and the appearance of the project so that the helmet will be better and easy to get close to the customers. Business Management skill can help the workers to make their timetable and works so that they will work effectively. One more important factor that this skill can help the workers is they will have the responsibility for their own works. Finally, Building Relationship will make link the workers to the employ or workers to other companies’ members. The better relationship is the better outcome will improve in the future. Relationship is important in business and cooperation.
 Next, Creativity is the next important requirements in my requirement to employ people for my team. Creativity is important because it will bring the project the next phase with new function, appearance, and the way to get the attention from the customers. Finally, working as a group is hard if team members do not work together effectively so that my most important requirement is teamwork. All four people need to have the ability to work in a team. If my teammates work together effectively, the project will be better in the future.
</p>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<h5>Nick's Feedback</h5>
<p>
<br>Khang is a good teammate with many skills and knowledge about this major and assignment but he needs to pay more attention and be more responsible for the group. This is group assignment, not individual and Khang always be late for meeting and deadline of the group. It affects a lot to the working process. He should have more effort and response to improve himself. Overall, he had done well in his work.
</br></p>

<p><br>
Duc did great job in this assignment in his individual part and group part. He is a group leader, but he is too kind in prompting teammates to do their work. He got stress because he took too much works. He should be stricter in forcing teammates to do their works so that the work process will be more effectively. Overall, he had done great job in this assignment.
</br></p>

<p><br>Khoi had done well in this assignment. He had completed all the individual deadlines, but he needs to attend more in group meeting. He usually did his work at home so that he not attended much in group meeting at the beginning. Khoi had put a lot of afford and worked hard to complete the works. </br></p>
<h5>Khang's feedback</h5>
<p><br>I think that our group have worked with each other for more than 10 weeks. I think that i have enough experiences and ideas about each member in the group. </br>
<br>To Duc, what i can see in him is that he is a great leader. He divide the work for each people is good, he has a good time management to finish all of the group deadline on time and also helping the others when they facing an obstacle. But the only thing that he needs to improve is not to create more stress. I think he should try to stop for a little bit, have some rest, relax his mind because with a stressful head, normal people can not do anything, even make the situation become worse than before. </br>
<br>About Nick, he is a great teammates that our group happy to have him in. He is smart, have greate ideas of how to create, make our group assignment to reach the highest marks and submit all of the group deadline on time. The only thing that I think he need to improve is about his writing. He often miss some of the spelling in the sentences. Another one is the way that he explain something, it is a little bit harsh. </br>
<br>Khoi, i think, is one of the best group member i have ever seen. He is hard-working, finish the project always on time and also when he tells me about what i have done wrong, his attitude makes me feel comfortable and easy to understand what i have done wrong. The only down side of Khoi is he often takes too much stuff to handle at the same time, which can make the other become freely. </br>
<br>Lastly, myself. For 10 weeks, i have know more how to become a useful, great teammate. I often finish my work the best i can because i cannot do something without putting all of my responsibility, which make my work seems not to have any fix or change when the other members in our group take a look at my work. But among of that, the thing that i need to improve is my time-management. I often late for group deadline and also group meetings, which makes myself feel embarrassed, and also create bad impression to other member in the group. I think that is the only thing that i need to improve. </br>
</p>
<h5>Khoi's Feedback</h5>
<p>Duc is the best leader that i have ever met. He knows how to split a reasonable amount of work for each member to make it fair for everyone. He also gives plenty of time so everyone can finish. However, these also make him stress a little bit because he has to manage and check so many things.
Nick has a lot of brilliant ideas, some of them are for fun but there are still a lot of useful functions. He has a sense of humor, he makes us laugh a lot and that sometimes kind of distracts us for work.
Khang is a valuable teammate, he can give some advice and contribute useful ideas to other members. Nevertheless, he is often late to the group meeting.
Last member is me, I cannot really see how my performance turned out, what is my good and bad side. That definitely is my negative side, unable to scale my ability. However, I think I have done a great job in giving suggestions to others.</p>

<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
<h4>Nick's Reflection</h4>
<p>Now, it is time of the end period of Assignment 3. In my opinion, my group had done well in following setup deadline. I had performed great in this assignment. The evidence is I had completed the individual works before due date. Everything is worked well enough in planning, meeting, and working together as a group. Things have two faces which are positive and negative faces. Each member needs to pay attention in the meeting and follow the plan but Khang sometimes not pay attention the aim and the goals of the project so that he did his individual parts not well enough but the problem had been fixed. My group should improve the ways to force team members to do their works and have more responsibility in their works. I surprised that my team always paid times to work with each other in the meeting room and coffee shop. I knew that everyone had their own works to do, not only the assignment but we still spend a lot of time together to do the assignment. I am very happy about the emotion, effort and the responsible of my teammates. I have learned that working in group is not easy like I think. Everyone needs to help each other to do their work so that the group can work together effectively. In assignment 3, I and my teammates still used Github to connect our works together. At this time, we already had the experience in using Github so that until the end we just have one problem about merging the work, but problem fixed right the way.
</p>
<h4>Khang's Reflection</h4>
<p><br>Throughout assignment 3, the cooperation between each member I think is the thing that went well. Although there is still some disagreement, all of us have listened and discussed the best answer to solve the different ideas of each other. Aside from that, the only thing that needs to be changed is the concentration of each member in the group, including me. When we have a group meeting, we sometimes being off-topic and also forget about some of the crucial points when we are having a discussion. The thing that surprises me the most while I working with my group is the way that they have managed the time to finish each section of the assignment, and also the problem-solving method when they face a problem. From this group, I am able to manage my time better when the leader of the group gives me the work to finish, also the view about the problem, how to solve the problem in the easiest, fastest, most effective way. I think that our group has a good skill while interacting with the Github log, we have been able to push our work up there, stored and have a discussion of each other works that are those right or being off-topic. Although sometimes, some members still push all of there work on it before they have pulled it down, create some conflict, we still able to handle the situation well and the most important thing, solve the problem, save all of the content of our work stored on Github.

</br></p>
<h4>Khoi's Reflection</h4>
<p> I think that we have done a really great job in this assignment. I think we have collaborated very well with each other to create such an amazing idea. We rarely have serious errors, we do have one which is definitely my fault. This happened when I pushed a session to Github, before that I had pulled to update the work on my personal computer. However, somehow the day after we found out that some information had been overwritten. In contrast, we are bad at following the deadlines that we have created to structure our project. Duc, the leader, always gave the deadlines to the members but we were always late. I think that is the biggest issue that we need to improve. The most surprising thing is how well the concept of the helmet turned out. At the beginning, it was just a combination of two different ideas, but then throughout the project, we just fantasize about what our dream helmet is for driving and turn those dreams into one of the helmet functions. Moreover, those ideas are also what I am able to learn about my team. I learn that we can take ideas for the simplest place and do not need to be complicated, sometimes it can be taken from our daily problems. Additionally, I learned that being a leader is not an easy job, it is not as simple as telling everyone what to do but it requires a lot more skills than I expected. Github is not the only place we collaborate, sometimes we just simply send our work to others so they can organize it before posting it to Github, so we could not see the true contribution of each member on Github repository.
